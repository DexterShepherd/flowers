A project for the calarts digital arts expo 2015

This project aims to visualize the effect of randomness within a deterministic system. Particles are created with random velocities and quickly accelerate to a constant speed. all variation within the sytstem stems from the initial random velocity. Free to change to origin points of the particles relative to the 
destinations, the bounds of the initial randomness, and the number of destinations per system to generate new pattenrs. 

Thank you to Daniel Shiffman for the motion vector code, Owen Vallis, Jordan Hochenbaum, and Ajay Kapur.
